1. Open and Read files:
file=open('filename.txt')  # open is a key word

2. Using try and except to handle exceptions

3. Writting files
   1) Create a file to write using: file=open('filename', 'w') # 'w' means write
   If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh.
   If the file does not exist, a new file will be created then
   2) Write data using file.write('content')
   3. Close the writing file using: file.write()
