1. The elements of a list don't have to be the same type. A list within another list is nested.

2. Lists are mutable.

3. List operations:
   1) + operator: concatenates lists 
   2) * operator repeats a list a given number of times
   3) The slice operator also works on lists.
   
4. List method:   
   1) append(element): append an element to the end of the list
   2) extend(list): append all elements in list t the end of another list
   3) sort(): sort all elements in list from low to high
   4) pop(index): delete the element with the given index, and return the remaining list
   5) pop(): delete and return the last element in the list
   6ï¼‰del list[index]: delete element with given index in the list
   7) remove(element): remove the specific element

5. Functions: sum, max, min, len

6. Convert a string to list: using list(string), or split(), or split(delimiter) delimiter=' ', ',', and so on

############################## IMPORTANT RULE*************************************************** 
7. An object with more than one reference has more than one name, then this object is aliased. If this object is mutable, changes made with one alias effect the others
